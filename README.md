This algorithm should be able to:

- Monitor all four sensor readings (temperature, humidity, light, and moisture)every X minutes.
- For each sensor reading that meets the requirement for watering, light up the respective LED.
- Determine if all four sensor readings meet the requirement for watering.
- Determine if the plant has already been watered significantly for the day
- Properly light the two LEDs that will represent the H-bridge when watering is needed.
- Log the time, date, sensor readings, and watering status every time sensor readings are conducted.
